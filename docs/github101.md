# Github 101
This page starts with some background on version control and github. Click [here](#hands-on) to skip to the hands-on part of the tutorial.


## What is version control?
* A formal system for tracking line-by-line changes in your work. Additional features include maintaining distinct working versions and assisting with merging them, ability to sync updates from one machine to another, and viewable histories of changes.
* Version control can be done without Github. There is a software tool called `git`, and others, that allow you to do version control on your computer. Github, Gitlab, etc... are services that take `git` to the cloud. 
* Version control is generally used at the project level. Sometimes there may be more than one "repository" as part of a project, but this is a more advanced case. 

## What is Github?
* Github is a webpage that helps with version control and sharing/collaboration.
* It acts as a "remote" host for your projects so that they are accessible from the internet.
* It can serve project webpages through a service called github-pages. 
* Provides both public and private repositories.


## Why is version control important for scientific work?
These are some brief points on the value of version control. For more, see the section on [best practices for reproducible research]()

* Collaboration - having your code on github makes it easy to share with a collaborator. Just add them as a collaborator, or send a link if the repo is public. They will be able to keep up to date with all of your changes.
* Work history and versioning for results - each commit has a unique ID and can be assigned a label ("tag"). You can record the ID or assign a label to the commit used to generate a specific set of results, say, for a manuscript. 
* Branching and merging - you can create "branches" of your code to add new functionality or restructure your code while keeping the main version untouched, then "merge" the branch into the main version when its ready to go. 
* Reproducibility - When it gets to be time to share the project with collaborators or as part of publication, having a github repo with the code means you can be sure that all users have the same code and folder setup you do.
